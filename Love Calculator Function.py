# Love Calculator
# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª 
# You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.  To work out the love score between two people: 
# 1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.   
# 2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.   
# 3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out. 
# e.g.
# name1 = "Angela Yu" name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times 
# R occurs 1 time 
# U occurs 2 times 
# E occurs 2 times 
# Total = 5 
# L occurs 1 time 
# O occurs 0 times 
# V occurs 0 times 
# E occurs 2 times 
# Total = 3 
# Love Score = 53
